Rock, Paper, Scissors game
===========================

Objective
---------
Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 
In the first version the game will consist on a set of Javascript functions that can be used 
to play from the browser's console.
In the next version a GUI is added to the game, so it can be played directly without using the
console. There will be several versions of the GUI oriented game.
